## Top Application Capabilities
- IIT students can write detailed descriptions of what to expect in courses, from past students
    - First-hand experience vs information from a professor
- IIT students and professors can search for courses to find reviews and experiences from previous students
- IIT students can leave a rating out of 5 stars for the courses in their reviews

## Scenarios

### Scenario #1
The spring semester has recently ended, and Bob is about to graduate from IIT. He has had such a great experience with a particular course that he would like to tell people about it. Additionally, he would like to provide feedback about classes he has not enjoyed so that he can send a word of warning to incoming students that are considering those courses which can also serve as feedback to the professors who taught those courses. He feels that the wisdom he has gained over the years he spent at IIT can be of help to students starting down the same road he started four years ago. He has seen websites such as RateMyProfessor and receives an email notifying him of a new website which can be used to publicly rate the courses themselves. It is everything he was yearning for.
### Scenario #2
Billy Jr is an incoming freshman to IIT, he’s already ahead a good amount of credits which he’s really excited about! The only thing is, he feels a tad bit intimidated about being thrown into higher level courses at IIT since he has already fulfilled their prerequisites in high school. He’s curious about how difficult they might be, and what past students thought of the course. On top of worrying about course difficulty, he has no idea which professors to take specific classes with and which to avoid, since he’s new to the school.
### Scenario #3
After the Fall semester, Professor Joe Smith sits down on his computer and views the scarce official course evaluations submitted by students at the end of the semester to see what he can do better to help students understand the material. He sees that the generic questions and ratings provided by IIT do not really give him an understanding of the critical feedback that would help him become a better professor at IIT. Professor Smith views the course and professor database, IITExposed, and sees that the student reviews provide honest feedback for his course and uses this tool allowing him to improve his teaching in the Spring semester passing it onto other professors recommending it as a solution to become a better professor and to build a better university.
